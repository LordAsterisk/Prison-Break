Help the prisoner escape from prison!

I thought it would be fun to try and make a little game for a prisoner to escape a cell. 

Hold down the mouse to make the prisoner cry—poor guy—but don't feel too bad, since eventually there will be so much water that he can float in his tears and escape through the conveniently placed hole on the ceiling!

When I first started drawing this, I quickly realized that it was really difficult for me to make a very basic stick figure. It was then that I came across "rectMode(CORNERS)". This made things easier to use, but it still was pretty tricky. That's when I discovered "beginShape()"! This immediately made everything much easier. Suddenly, instead of trying to make many rectangles connect, I could just make one shape that has bends and angles. I still was very confused every time I adjusted the y axis (Lower numbers are higher?!?) but hopefully that will improve with practice.
