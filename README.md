# Prison-Break
Help the prisoner escape from prison!

For this sketch, I thought it would be fun to try and make a little game for a prisoner to escape a cell. As you hold down the mouse, the prisoner cries. Eventually there is so much water that he can float in his tears, and then escaping is as simple as moving the prisoner out through the conveniently placed hole on the ceiling.

When I first started drawing this, I quickly realized that it was really difficult for me to make a very basic stick figure. It was then that I came across "rectMode(CORNERS)". This made things easier to use, but it still was pretty tricky. That's when I discovered "beginShape()"! This immediately made everything much easier. Suddenly, instead of trying to make many rectangles connect, I could just make one shape that has bends and angles. I still was very confused every time I adjusted the y axis (Lower numbers are higher?!?) but hopefully that will improve with practice.
